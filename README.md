## Description

This is a website about me. You can see what skills I've learnt and what projects I've created. You can also get in touch with me if you're interested in hiring me.

I created this website as part of a project for the YouCode Frontend Developer course.

This project was started with Create React App.

## Demo

## Technologies
- React
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Styled Components
- JavaScript(ES6+)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
